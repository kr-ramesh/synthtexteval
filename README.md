Downstream evaluation metrics:
- [ ] Question-answering setup for synthetic data that is formatted in a Q/A format.
- [ ] Coreference resolution: Needs to be merged with the main branch. [Important]

Privacy metrics: 
- [ ] For memorization evaluation in language models, can refer to: https://github.com/locuslab/acr-memorization
- [ ] Reformat and make the entity extraction code more efficient. [Important]
- [ ] Merge additional metrics (Zihao) to the main branch. [Important]
- [ ] Should we add text anonymization functionality?

Misc: 
- [ ] Synthetic data generation code with and without differential privacy
- [ ] Adding differentially private training for the downstream classifier
- [ ] What other qualitative metrics can we add to improve data quality estimation? (Reference: Qualitative & descriptive eval branches) [Important]
