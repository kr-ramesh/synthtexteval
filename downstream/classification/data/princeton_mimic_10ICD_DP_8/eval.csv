Goals:
1. Avoid any major arrhythmias by the end of the procedure.

  DURATION: 24 minutes

INCIDENT: The procedure may be completed in 19.


INSTRUCTIONS:  Following the patient's 48 hour ECG and 911 call, the physician will make this determination.

PRECAUTIONS:  No known history of stroke.

REPORT ON MEDICAL PERFORMANCE:

The patient had a sinus rhythm with a ST segment depression at the 1900s. Her left bundle branch block was thought to be due to AV block. The EKG was performed on the patient in the ICU. The EKG showed a sinus rhythm at the 1900s without change in ST changes. The tracing was consistent with right bundle branch block. A left atrial septal defect was also found and was thought to be causing the arrhythmia.

The patient did have a slight heart block on the tracing. The tracing showed right ventricular failure at the 1900 and the ventricular enlargement could potentially be due to the left bundle branch block.  The patient was started on digoxin.

DISCUSSION:
This infant was born at 17:33 minutes 2 hours 11 minutes to 3-25-80% by
weight.  He had a difficult birth, requiring 2 attempts at vaginal birth,
and a cesarean at [**1-33**].  A thorough maternal intrapartum history was
compiled.  The infant was born at 39 weeks, 5.8% at birth.

This infant had a difficult labor and was resuscitated after
neck compression, although the infant's breathing status was
unclear.  The mother requested an induction and underwent the
induction at 17:33 minutes 2 hours 11 minutes, to 3-25-78% in

1. Narrowed CHN, but not compromised on MRA or MRA-DWI.

2. Mildly elevated EEG.

SYSTOLIC HYPERRESPIRATION: Mildly elevated EEG in supine.
This is likely to be caused by excessive inspiratory effort
during exercise, but may be a more severe episode than
reported. If further exertion should occur, elevated EEG should be
compensated with supplemental oxygen.

3. Increased RR with aortic stenosis (STS 59) with an increase in

Conclusion:  Cumulative results from the maternal


Sinuous sinus node procedure, a right heart tracing, a left
heart tracing, and right atrial biopsy performed by Dr.
Matsuda were as follows:


1. Right sided heart tracing: The right sided heart tracing was performed
with 36x23 mm electrocardiographic screen, which was interpreted by
Dr. Yukihiro Kawashima as a case of right heart failure with LVEF
< 50% in a 63 year old patient with a history of hypertension with
blood pressure at 150/96 mm Hg. There was a large pulmonary artery
crossover with multiple pulmonary artery thrombi and large
vessel wall thickness on the left side, which was identified in
the study. A single vessel origin is shown on both the right
and left side of the right atrium, with a pulmonary artery crossover
at the left atrial terminus. Right atrium tracing was also
interpreted",['4019'],[3]

tachycardia and hypoxic head injury.  There was marked bilateral head
mass effect, which was consistent with the findings at birth.  The
latter portion of the fetal brain and foramen were also hypoplastic.

IN-HOSPITAL CORRELATION:  There was an increase in BA (2-5%) during fetal
cardiac monitoring and decreased BA to 2% at the end of the study,

Historical Record of this Patient's Cardiac Surgery Admission:

The patient came to the Emergency Department to be admitted for left
thoracic surgery that was recommended by the previous cardiothoracic
surgery team (CTS) as a potential candidate for lung transplantation.
The patient also presented to the Emergency Department due to
pulmonary and cardiac distress related to cardiac failure, chronic
cardiac arrhythmia, and severe sleep apnea (SA).

Due to the patient's advanced age (~ 69 years) and his current
complications, he was considered a high surgical risk.

Initially, a patient was considered to be a candidate for lung
transplant. The patient was scheduled for aortic valve surgery (AVS),
but the patient opted not to proceed with the transplant until
after aortic surgery had been completed. The patient was initially
admitted to the Emergency Department via a nasal","['41401', '4280']","[4, 6]"

General Information: Aortic root disease is classified as idiopathic and non-valvular.  It is usually a variant of valvular aortic regurgitation.

Aortic root disease is a common heritable disorder of aortic valve that
occurs due to a mutation in ANOX genes. The exact cause of
degeneration is not known. It is usually asymptomatic but may be
a risk factor for coronary artery disease.  Patients with
renal or coronary artery disease and coronary artery bypass graft
patients with a high-risk coronary artery disease should
be screened for aortic root disease.

On 03/27/18 at 7:27 AM  EDT, we began the procedure for the surgical revascularization of the right side of the right ventricle.

Surgical Repair
Pre-operatively, the right ventricular infarction was diagnosed by ct angiogram and right ventricular function was assessed for its severity. A T/P of 27 was chosen for this patient as compared to a T/P greater than 50.

The decision to use the left and right ventricle to graft to the left atrium was made in consideration of the previous dural infarction noted on the ct.

Prior to the surgical procedure, the patient was placed in our surgical suite for blood studies and ct. An MRI was performed as well to plan for the placement of the graft.


In the operating room, there was some discomfort from the anesthesia, and the patient had difficulty focusing, but otherwise was cooperative. In the pre-surgical CT, there was a small mass in the right ventricle. In the operating room, the mass was removed, and the right ventricle was closed with 1mm Trapnell's suture and 1mm Silk thread.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 66 year-old male presented with
acute chest pain and a history of chest pain and shortness
of breath to a localized area.  He was on oxygen at admission
with an MDS.  He denies fever, chills, or a loss of
appetite.  He did experience 3-4 chest pains lasting
5 - 15 minutes each.  He was treated with
oxygen, epinephrine, and antacids.  He was taken to the
cath lab and had a SVC cath.  The initial results were
not as favorable with 69% stenosis.  The operator was
attempting to do a balloon to stent his SVC, but to no
avail.  He was then transferred to the ED and transferred
to MGH/MIHU.  His lungs were clear and he was in respiratory
distress.  He was evaluated for a potential MDS.

DIAGNOSTIC IMPLICATIONS

I. Sinews:  Normal, without apparent abnormality, although
not quite so soft as seen on MRI prior to cardiac cath, but
more normal

II. Echocardiogram was within the normal limits.  This was
done with the same patient that underwent the cath on MRI (999)
and compared with a previous echocardiogram done when he had
his right ventricle transposition surgery.


RECOMMENDATIONS


1. He is an older male that can live at least another 10 years.

2. The patient has very stable left ventricular systolic
function.  The LVAS is not compromised by myocardial
ventricular dysfunction.  He appears to be in the normal LV
functional range with aortic outflow regurgitation.

3. He is fit for the cardiologist to perform aortic regurgitation
study and to evaluate for left ventricular hypertrophy.

The father, born to a Caucasian mother is a college student and a heavy smoker.

In 1997, his mother suffered a miscarriage with a pregnancy of 20 weeks.
The father was then genetically tested and was found to have a
histo-chromosome 17p11 deletion, the chromosomal lesions being
found to be heterozygous for chromosome 7p22.3, the chromosomal
gap being at least 31 bases, and the linkage pattern between the
chromosomes 7 and 11 being missing in only 2 of 60 pairs.  Further
research reveals that the mother of the father also carries a
chromosomal breakage in the first intron of the gene encoding
the alpha subunit of the alpha-subunit of the beta-subunit of
the alpha-chain of factor Viii.

His mother was diagnosed as suffering from a fatal
chromosomal breakage due to an unknown defect which is now
attributed to methylation of one of the genes encoding the alpha
subunit of factor Viii, the father as well.

#  Hereford, October 25, 2004

Discharged patient was admitted from St. Peter's
Hospital on October 8, 2004, for the operation to
repair a perforation of the left atrial septum.  The initial
diagnosis was left atrial septal rupture and the patient
would have otherwise undergone an operation to repair the
left atrial septum.  Previous surgical history is
considered to be extensive.  The patient received a
surgical clot retrieval  of the left atrial appendage by
anterior communicating type 3 (AC3) repair and a
left atrial septal suture (LAS) of the left atrial septum.  The
left atrial appendage is the left common and right
atrial ventricles and the LAA was repaired with a right
atrial clamp (RAC) with the use of a right radial
catheter (the right ventricular catheter was not used).  After
the left atrial appendage is repaired, the RAC was removed,","['25000', '2720', '41401']","[0, 1, 4]"
