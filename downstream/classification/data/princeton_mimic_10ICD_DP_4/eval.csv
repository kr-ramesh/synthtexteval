Issue Discussion.

Exhume the body in a sealed container. Find the right size for the size
of the specimen. If the specimen is too large, it will be hard
to get a good vascular seal, as there will be blood
flow. This may cause necrosis, leading to a more difficult
exhumation, especially when the surface of the tissues may
stain blue.

Six pound three month male infant, delivered with no mention of cesarean section.  His mother, a healthy 22 year old Hispanic female, was seen on the admission floor of NICU at
29 gestational weeks, when she was found in the delivery room.  She was admitted with fevers
and a fecal incontinence.  Labor did not progress at 36 weeks, therefore a vacutated vaginal
birth plan was instituted.  The infant was monitored for 5 hours.  All measurements at birth
were within normal limits, which was the goal for such an early delivery.  The infant's
neonatal care was continued in NICU.  In the first 12 hours post delivery there
was an initial assessment on the mother's blood work results.  There was significant elevation of
bilirubin in the cord blood.  The mother is on warfarin and on lisinopril.  There
are elevations in her labs.  She is scheduled for follow up with the hematologist
at 5pm, to determine the need for transfusion.  The infant was sent home and has been

1. HISTORY OF HIGH RISK PATIENT:
8 year old boy with a history of hypotonia was evaluated for a
seizure. He was admitted for possible hypotonia and for his
suspected ET or ASD. There were concerns that his childhood
history and medications put him at risk for epilepsy. On the
initial presentation, he developed a 3 hour seizure that was
probably epileptic. The EEG was obtained, and he was diagnosed
as having ET and ASD. The ET was suspected because of the seizure
and ET was suspected because of the seizure. The ET was
non localized and non convulsive and was thought to be
secondary to pyrroline, a substance that is thought to
prevent the seizure. At the hospital,",['42731'],[5]

On paper a baby who presents with mild pneumothorax and mild psoas hypoctonia with mild fetal distress, and who presents within a margin of disease of the brain may be considered for a possible transfer to the OR. It would appear that this baby has some transient oxygen desaturations (30%/70%).

complained of chest pain for the past two weeks.  Since 11/1/[/4]
I have been unable to concentrate, and I have had a very severe headache.
I took a dose of acetaminophen for the pain in my chest, and I

HISTORY OF CONTEXT
During admission there is a lot of hemodynamically significant findings that have been noted on the electronic
record since the last checkup in day 1.  There are some cardiac changes consistent with the diagnosis, and also
some evidence of CAD.  However, it is unclear which of these findings are associated with atherosclerosis.
It is also not known if there are any other cardiac risk factors in the patients family history.
Most likely these are attributable to age, hypertension, smoking history,  CHD history.

Review of Patient History

This patient presents for an assessment of the 2 year old boy, who was born at 34
weeks gestation, and whose placenta was delivered vaginally.  After
hospital admission, the parents were informed that the child
required surgical intervention.  The first intervention was on day 2,
when the boy was admitted to the Neo-natal Intensive Care
Unit.  After observation in the NICU for 6 days, a decision was made to
transfer him to the NICU for surgical consultation and to undergo
planned operative interventions, which included a partial right
craniotomy, right temporal decompression, and left temporal
cone decompression.  The parents were then contacted in the wee hours of
Monday morning, to be informed of the results of the operation.  The
patient was then transferred to the Intensive Care
Unit for critical care, where he spent the remainder of the time in
the pediatric intensive care unit.

On Tuesday morning, the child was placed on his mother's chest.  In

He underwent a chest x-ray which showed a right pulmonary infiltrate, bilateral pleural effusions and a right lung infection. The boy underwent CXR with contrast and intravenous hydration and then a computed tomography scan was done which showed bilateral pleural effusion and severe ascites with infiltration of the pleural space around the Lungs. A diagnosis was then made with the child showing a significant decrease in pulse rate and heart rate with fluid infusion to increase his cardiac output and thereby decrease cardiac output, with a trend toward recovery in cardiac output in the next 3 hours, but then with increasing fluid in the pleural space the child started to become more difficult.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  My 73 years old patient with
past history of hypertensive cardiovascular disease was
assessed at [**Hospital3 289**] on [**2109-10-30**] for an episode of dizziness,
dihydropyridine toxicity, syncope, and left atrial enlargement
followed with a catheterization, which revealed severe
ischemia.  On admission he was in general good condition
with a BP of 165/85, heart rate of 95, blood pressure of 94
with a Q10 of 28.  He had a prior stroke with seizure, a
1969 AMI, TAC 1.15 at 10:15, and a stent placed in a right
atrial appendage.  He has had prior hypertension which
probably exacerbated his
ischemia.  He is on ACEI which has not had any response.

 The patient has a right bundle branch block (RBBB).  There is no ST elevation
 which would be the norm for a RBBB and a possible STE elevation
 would be not unusual for an STE related to heart failure.  A

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The 56 yr female mother of a 3 month
old daughter presented with fever and lethargy.  Her daughter was
tired in the morning and vomiting when the patient was sent
home with an iodine drops prescription.  Her son went to the
patient's home for 2 hours at nighttime, however the patient
was not cared for during this time, but rather just rested and
watched the TV in the living room.  The patient told me that
this was a concern to her, as she wanted her daughter to know
about the risk of bacteria.  She said that it wasn't a
significant concern.  The patient noted that the baby was
crying and it was hard to keep the baby awake, as the baby had
difficulty sleeping, so the mother did not know the baby.

this is the ideal setting for a D-PA and possible surgical evaluation.  However, as this was a very unwell
patient, it should only be used as a first approach and the decision

The infant boy was referred to IRH from ER for evaluation and treatment of possible
chylomicronemia.  He was noted to have an OI, high grade fever, increased respiratory effort and
sudden onset respiratory distress requiring transfer to Hospital for observation.
Based on history and exam the boy's fever is thought to be secondary to viral
infection.  The infant is dewormed and vaccinated. The patient is noted to be
severely dehydrated, therefore he will be given intravenous fluids.  On arrival the
infant had an increased respiratory rate and was hyperventilating.  The initial
workup included antibiotics, steroids and antiparasitics.  In addition he was
referred to ER for observation.

Based on these results, it is recommended that the following procedure be performed.
1. In accordance with the recommendations of the Clinical Guideline for the
Management of Myocardial Infarction, the primary goal of this
procedure is to place a Dacron and Telfa stent graft to the
left anterior descending coronary artery and repair the left anterior
descending coronary artery.
2. Given the finding of stenosis of the left anterior descending
coronary artery, an implantation of a stent graft into this left
anteroscapic coronary artery graft can be performed, and an
endovascular stent graft in this same anterior descending coronary
artery can be placed.
3. When this graft is placed into this left anterior descending
coronary artery and a stent graft in the same anterior descending
coronary artery is not placed, the primary goals of this procedure
are to:
1. Redo the primary goal of stent grafting into the left anterior
descending coronary artery to repair the left anterior descending
coronary artery and to prevent the distal left anterior descending

On this date, the first procedure was to the RAD artery; the RAD artery was identified by placement of a small endoprosthesis in the tricuspid groove and it went straight into the RAD.
To confirm the position of the graft, an x-ray was performed. The x-ray showed a graft in the RAD artery and the graft was delivered at the anastomotic site.
The patient was then placed on an ECMO, in the operating room, to place the graft. 
The procedure was completed successfully and a follow-up CT scan (at 24 hours) showed no evidence of leakage.

This child was born in the ward for unassisted infants and did not pass through the nursing pool prior to discharge. The mother complained of fever and dehydration and it was believed the mother had recently been on bedrest and was therefore susceptible to typhoid fever. A thorough history was taken. The mother stated her husband had a long-standing illness of a heart condition and the father had dementia. She had some short-term seizures and was on a diuretic and her mother had previously been taking her. She was 14 weeks old and 870 grams. The mother did not have a fever upon arrival but she had some fever a day or two before that. She was a little pale and sweaty but there was no rashes and no diapers. She was noted to have some seizure activity with this child. The mother was taken to the NICU with the mother for monitoring. The mother was taken to NICU for observation as her fever was persistent and at 159.5 and she had a blood count of 9.7, a respiratory rate of 22.4, an oxygen saturation of 94 in room air and a heart rate of 110 with no tachycardia.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
Vomiting, constipation, chest pain, palpitations, sore throat,
and fever, along with a tachycardia and elevation of CPK.

On [**2143-9-19**], the patient was sent to [**Hospital12 805**] by her physician for an ECG,
followed by a CT of the chest, to rule out
embolic myocarditis.  A follow-up PSA of 7.34 mmol/L [**8-3-21**] and
lumbar puncture confirmed no chest tube or infection.  ECG did not
detect myocardial ischemia, but there was a left bundle branch block
accompanying a nonischemic ST segment that was initially thought
to be a possible first degree AV block but an ECHO confirmed
occlusion of the left superior and anterosuperior cerebellar
vein with a non-obstructing stenosis of the left common carotid
artery.","['2724', '4019', '41401']","[2, 3, 4]"

The last lines of a 74-year-old woman who had a myocardial infarction in
2006 is presented here.  The patient has had three stents inserted
for MI in 2006, and has had a pacemaker inserted in 2005, so there is
evidence of cardiac failure and RV systolic dysfunction.  She has
experienced heart failure for the last few years.  She has had
electrolyte abnormalities for at least the last year as well,
which has resulted in her being on two daily infusions of 20 units of
mol/kg/hr orally.  There are no other significant comorbidities
present.  She had had left ventricular assist devices placed
(left anterior aortic) and right atrial devices, so she has left
ventricular function.
